# Task Overview
This project contains a Bash script that automates the backup of system logs from the **/var/log** directory. The script performs the following tasks:

Creates a backup of the /var/log directory.
Compresses the backup with a timestamped filename.
Deletes backups older than 7 days to manage storage efficiently.
## Features  
**Automated Backup:** Creates and compresses log backups.  
**Timestamped Files:** Ensures each backup has a unique timestamped filename.  
**Auto Cleanup:** Deletes backups older than 7 days.  
**Logging:** Logs backup status and errors for troubleshooting.  
**Modular & Efficient:** Uses best practices in Bash scripting.  

## Script Details
The script performs the following steps:  

**Defines Variables**  

**BACKUP_DIR:** Storage location for backups (/var/log-backups).  
**LOG_DIR:** Directory to back up (/var/log).  
**TIMESTAMP:** Generates a timestamp for unique filenames.  
**LOG_FILE:** Stores script execution logs.  
**RETENTION_DAYS:** Specifies backup retention period (7 days).  
**Ensures the Backup Directory Exists**  

Creates the backup directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.  
Performs Backup & Compression
